====== Configuration of replacements in the substitution plan  ======

Here you can define replacements, which will be applied to the displayed substitution plan, i.e. for shortening very long teacher names or for highlighting certain event categories with a pre-defined css class.

The format is
<code>
Number searchstring|replacement|css-class
</code>

  * The numbers must be unique, otherwise the last entry will be used. The numbers do not need to be consecutive.
  * The css class is optional and can be left empty. If a class is specified, the text will be wrapped in a //span//-element with the specified class applied to it. Pre-defined classes are ''green'', ''orange'', ''red'' and ''blue'', which will display a small colored square in front of the text.
