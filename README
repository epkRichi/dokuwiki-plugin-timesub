timesub Plugin for DokuWiki

A simple plugin for displaying timesub substitutions in DokuWiki

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://github.com/ironiemix

For this plugin to work, you need to move the `curlupload.php` file to the root directory of your dokuwiki installation.
You also need to have the `php-zip` extension installed.

If you want to use the json export feature, you also need to have `mdbtools` installed.

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/timesub/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
